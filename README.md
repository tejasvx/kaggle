# kaggle
kaggle code for TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge

HOW TO RUN CODE

1. run makeNP_array.ipynb which will create numpy arrays of each category
2. run train.pynb to start training ( increase no. of epochs for better performance)
3. run testing.ipynb to test on .wav file of your choice which will print out the labels

# Future work
creating LSTM model to further increase the accuracy
